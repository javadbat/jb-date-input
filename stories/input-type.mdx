# Input type

jb-date-input support both jalali(shamcy) and gregorian(Miladi) calendar input type. like value-type that let you determine how you want to provide/expect data to/from jb-date-input you can specify how user must fill the date input.
to achieve this you have to set `input-type` attribute or set `inputType` object to component dom directly.
to set it as attribute you can set value like this:

```html

<jb-date-input input-type="GREGORIAN"></jb-date-input>
<jb-date-input input-type="JALALI"></jb-date-input>
```

and for doing it with direct DOM assignment you can use following js code:

```js
//to show gregorian calendar
document.querySelector('jb-date-input').inputType = "GREGORIAN" 
document.querySelector('jb-date-input').inputType = "JALALI"
```
Jalali example:
<Story of={DateInputStories.Jalali} />
Gregorian Example:
<Story of={DateInputStories.Gregorian} />
<br/>
<br/>

## ReactJS
in react js you just have to set `inputType` prop. here is the code:
<Source of={DateInputStories.Jalali} />
<Source of={DateInputStories.Gregorian} />

## Language of date-input 
JB Design System have a global i18n mechanism to determine which language is your component should render by default. [(see)](https://javadbat.github.io/design-system/?path=/docs/getting-started-introduction--docs&globals=locale:fa#internationalizationi18n)
in previous versions we use to load jalali in farsi and gregorian in english but currently we support both language in both input type.     
the easiest way to change the language of the input is that you set `lang="fa"` or `lang="en"` inside your `<html>` tag.

You can also change the language of the demo here by clicking at 🌐 icon in the header of the demo to see each component in your expected language.    
Here we show you jalali calendar with full persian setup:
<Story of={DateInputStories.JalaliWithPersianSetup} height='30rem' inline={false}/>
<Source of={DateInputStories.JalaliWithPersianSetup} />

## Difference With ValueType

`value-type` is an attribute we use to determine input value format and has no effect on what user see. for example if you set `value-type="JALALI"` and ``input-type="GREGORIAN"`` user will see a gregorian calendar but when you get value by `document.querySelector('jb-date-input').value` you will get `1400-08-24` means value is jalali but calendar is gregorian
